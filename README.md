# ChainPilot-AI - Multi-Agent Logistics Optimizer

"An intelligent orchestration engine for delivery chains using LangGraph, LLMs, and real-time route intelligence."

https://sahanakhanai-chainpilot-ai.streamlit.app/

Goal: Designed to revolutionize supply chain efficiency by leveraging a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize delivery routes, manage dynamic logistics operations, and provide real-time decision support for businesses in transportation and distribution sectors.

Development: Built using LangGraph for orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents, integrated with OpenRouteService for route optimization, and deployed on Streamlit for an interactive user interface. The system incorporates FAISS vector databases for knowledge retrieval, enabling contextual decision-making. The project follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability and easy integration into existing enterprise workflows.

Key Features:

Real-time route optimization with map visualization (OpenStreetMap/Google Maps).

Agent Trace Viewer for step-by-step execution tracking and an Explainable AI panel for transparency in decision-making.

Retry Failed Delivery simulation and agent performance breakdown for operational resilience.

Support for dynamic origin and destination inputs, making it adaptable to changing business needs.
